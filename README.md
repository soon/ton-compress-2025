# TON Compress 2025 contest implementation

## Intro

This repo is a source code to the submission for [TON Compress 2025 content](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/137533).

As a start you may want to ensure `./compile.sh solution.cpp executable && ./solution` is running correctly on your local. Note, that this executable has slightly different input format and is designed to test compression -> decompression flow in one run.

Next step is making sure `./test-min` is runnning locally - it minifies original solution code and switches it to a mode where it correctly handles compress / decompress requests.

## Implementation details

TODO - meanwhile here's a [short version](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/137533?#comment-1237834)
